## üá´üá∑ French Fan Translation

This fork is a **fan translation** of Pok√©mon Prism into **French**, initiated in 2025.

The goal is to fully localize the game for French-speaking players, including:
- Pok√©mon names and attack names
- Item names and descriptions
- Trainer types and dialogues
- In-game menus and system messages

The translated build will remain compatible with the original gameplay.
